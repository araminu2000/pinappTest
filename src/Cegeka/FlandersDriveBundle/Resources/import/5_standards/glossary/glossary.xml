</description>
			<explanation>NOTE 1 A number of checkpoints are used as a means of ensuring that the test requirements are satisfied.
NOTE 2 If four or fewer fixing points exist, each is used as a checkpoint. For packaged products, where a fixing
point may be interpreted as the packaging surface in contact with the vibration table, one checkpoint may be used,
provided that there are no effects due to resonances of the vibration table or the mounting structure in the
frequency range specified for the test. If this is the case, multipoint control may be necessary, but see also NOTE 3.
If more than four fixing points exist, four representative fixing points will be defined in the relevant specification to
be used as checkpoints.
NOTE 3 In special cases, for example for large or complex specimens, the checkpoints will be prescribed by the
relevant specification if not close to the fixing points.
NOTE 4 Where a large number of small specimens are mounted on one fixture, or in the case of a small specimen
with a number of fixing points, a single checkpoint (that is the reference point) may be selected for the derivation of
the control signal. This signal is then related to the fixture rather than to the fixing points of the specimen(s). This
procedure is only valid when the lowest resonance frequency of the loaded fixture is well above the upper
frequency of the test.</explanation>

surface area for holding charge resulting in much larger capacitance and energy density.
Electrochemical capacitors differ from common electrolytic capacitors in that they employ a liquid rather
than a solid dielectric with charge occurring at the liquid-solid interface of the electrodes when a
potential is applied. Some other common names for an electrochemical capacitor are ²double layer
