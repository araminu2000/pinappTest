			<p>The cells entering the recycling process can be first placed in storage. During the storage of the cells the main risk is thermal runway. 
			By checking the temperature of the cells (especially after moving the cells) regular the start of a thermal runaway can be detected. The area in which the modules are stored shall be well ventilated.</p>
			<p>The storage in which the cells are placed can be adapted to the specific risks.</p>
			<p>In case of a fire information about the stored goods must be given to the fire brigade. This can be done via the 
			‘Information for rescue and emergency services 1ste and 2nd responders – Lithium-ion batteries in a storage facility’. 
			This document is currently designed by CTIF and Recharge and is part of the program of given uniform information to rescue and emergency services.</p>
			<p>Background information on how to safely store Lithium-ion batteries, how to early detect a fire and how to act in 
			the different stages is described in <a href="http://193.104.8.63/bundles/cegekaflandersdrive/templates/guidelines/LiSAFE_Lithium-Ion%20batteries_storage%20guidelines.pdf">the guidelines of safely storing batteries</a>.</p>
