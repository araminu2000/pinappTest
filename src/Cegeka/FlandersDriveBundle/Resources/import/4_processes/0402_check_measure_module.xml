		<p>Before the assembly of the pack starts, the module can be measured and check to be sure it still has the wanted characteristics (voltage, current, ... ).</p>
		<p>During measuring of the modules the risk of external short circuit exists. Where possible it is recommended to cover one of the current collectors to avoid this risk.</p>
		<p>During the measuring the modules can be dropped or the module can be mechanical abused in another way. To decrease the effects (like leakage) when mechanical abuse occurs, the enclosure of the module shall be resistant against this abuse.</p>
		<p>When the modules are measured correct tooling need to be used to avoid electrical or mechanical abuse</p>
		<p>During these activities the temperature shall be monitored to detect the start of a thermal runaway.</p>
		<p>To decrease the effects of the risks, the operator shall wear safety gloves and glasses which protect against heat, sparks and electrolyte.</p>
