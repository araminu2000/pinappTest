			<p>When the cells are needed in the production line for module assembly, they can be moved from storage to production. During the activities the normal prevention measures of internal logistics need to be taken into account. These are for example:</p>
			<ul><li>Only skilled person can drive with a fork lift</li>
			<li>The limits of the fork lift may not be exceeded</li>
			<li>There shall be internal transportation rules (example ‘Intern verkeersplan’<b>Add TEMPLATE</b>)</li></ul>

			<p>When the modules are needed in production, they can be moved from storage to production. During the activities the normal prevention measures of internal logistics need to be taken into account to avoid mechanical abuse which can lead to temperature increase and gas formation or leakage.

			<p>The operator need to be aware of the probability that external short circuit can exists when modules are moved. To detect thermal runaway in an early stage, it is also recommended to monitor the temperature.</p>
