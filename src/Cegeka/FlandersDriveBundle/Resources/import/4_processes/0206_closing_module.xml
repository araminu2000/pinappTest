			<p>If necessary the module can be closed. In this last step the module need to be packed correctly
				During this step measures need to be taken to avoid electrical short circuit, leakage and thermal runaway. These measures are:</p>
			<ul><li>Covering current connector</li>
			<li>Avoid blunt tooling</li>
			<li>Avoid electrical and mechanical abuse</li></ul>
			<p>To decrease the effects of the risks, the operator shall wear safety gloves and glasses which protect against heat, sparks and electrolyte. 
				Monitoring the temperature can help to detect a thermal runaway in a early stage.</p>
