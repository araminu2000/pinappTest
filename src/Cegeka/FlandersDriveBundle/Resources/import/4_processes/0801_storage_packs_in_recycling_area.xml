			<p>At the beginning of the recycling process, old packs are delivered at the recycling plant. 
			These pack can be placed into storage. One of the main risk during storing old packs is thermal 
			runaway. By checking the temperature of the pack regular(especially after moving the packs) the start of a thermal runaway can be 
			detected. To avoid the propagation the packs need to be separated. The area in which the modules are stored shall be well ventilated.</p>
			<p>The storage in which the packs are placed can be adapted to the specific risks.</p>
			<p>In case of a fire information about the stored goods must be given to the fire brigade. This can be done via the 
			‘Information for rescue and emergency services 1ste and 2nd responders – Lithium-ion batteries in a storage facility’. 
			This document is currently designed by CTIF and Recharge and is part of the program of given uniform information to rescue and emergency services.</p>
			<p>Background information on how to safely store Lithium-ion batteries, how to early detect a fire and how to act in 
			the different stages is described in <a href="http://193.104.8.63/bundles/cegekaflandersdrive/templates/guidelines/LiSAFE_Lithium-Ion%20batteries_storage%20guidelines.pdf">the guidelines of safely storing batteries</a>.</p>
