			<p>A normal storage area is an area where no measures are taken to cope with the risks of lithium-ion batteries. These can for example be
			areas to store temporally batteries.</p>
			<p>In case there is a fire, the fire brigade need to know where dangerous goods are stored. It is 
			therefore recommended to at information of battery storage to the intervention plan.</p>
			<p>When the batteries are stored in a normal area the same risk of thermal runaway exists. 
			The effect of the consequences of the thermal runway can be much worse. If a cells are 
			placed in this type of area, the measures to detect thermal runaway and avoid propagation are valid. More awareness and monitoring is needed .</p>
