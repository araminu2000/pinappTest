			<p>After the pack assembly, packs needs to be tested to check if it fulfils the design 
			requirements. Packs that pass the end of line test can be used in the vehicle production.

			<p>In the first step of the testing, the manual service disconnected must be connected. For safety reasons 
			this disconnect should be disconnected as long as possible to reduce the exposure to the highest pack voltages.</p>

			<p>During the measuring of the pack, measures need to be taken to avoid electrocution and thermal runaway:</p>
			<ul><li>Cover the current collector of the pack whenever is possible</li>
			<li>Use of high voltage gloves</li>
			<li>Monitoring the temperature can help to detect a thermal runaway in a early stage.</li></ul>
