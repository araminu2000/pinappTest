			<p>The modules entering the recycling process can be first placed in storage. These modules are:
			<ul><li>scrap modules from the production process</li>
			<li>resulting from the pack disassembling</li></ul>
			<p>During the storage of the modules the main risk is thermal runway. By checking the temperature of the modules (especially after moving the modules) 
			regular the start of a thermal runaway can be detected.	The area in which the modules are stored shall be well ventilated.</p>
			<p>The storage in which the modules are placed can be adapted to the specific risks.</p>
			<p>In case of a fire information about the stored goods must be given to the fire brigade. This can be done via the 
			‘Information for rescue and emergency services 1ste and 2nd responders – Lithium-ion batteries in a storage facility’. 
			This document is currently designed by CTIF and Recharge and is part of the program of given uniform information to rescue and emergency services.</p>
			<p>Background information on how to safely store Lithium-ion batteries, how to early detect a fire and how to act in 
			the different stages is described in <a href="http://193.104.8.63/bundles/cegekaflandersdrive/templates/guidelines/LiSAFE_Lithium-Ion%20batteries_storage%20guidelines.pdf">the guidelines of safely storing batteries</a>.</p>
