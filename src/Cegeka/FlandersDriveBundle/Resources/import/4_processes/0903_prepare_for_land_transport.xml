			<h3><strong>Translational period</strong></h3>
			<p>Depending in the period of production, cells, modules and packs can be transported according to the following time frame:</p>
			<ul><li>Lithium cells, modules and packs manufactured before 1 July 2003 which had been tested in accordance with the requirements applicable until 31 December 2002 but which had not yet been tested in accordance with the requirements applicable as from 1 January 2003, and appliances containing such lithium cells, modules or packs, bay continue to be carried up to 30 June 2013 if all the other applicable requirements are fulfilled.</li>
			<li>Lithium cells and batteries manufactured before 1 January 2014 which had been tested in accordance with the requirements applicable as from 1 January 2013, and appliances containing such lithium cells or batteries, may continue to be carried if all the other applicable requirements are fulfilled.</li></ul>
			<h3><strong>Exemptions from the testing requirements:</strong></h3>
			<p>For the exemptions under the road and maritimee transport modes see special provision 310.</p>
			<p>The testing requirements in sub-section 38.3 of the Manual of Tests and Criteria do not apply to:</p>
			<ul><li>Low production runs consisting of not more than 100 cells and batteries.</li>
			<li>Pre-production prototues of lithium cells and batteries when these prototypes are transported for testing.</li>
			<li>Use Packing Group I packagings.</li></ul>

			<h3><strong>Packaging</strong></h3>
			<p>Dangerous goods shall be packed in good quality packagings. The packaging needs to avoid mechanical damage during transport, handling and stacking of the goods. This is to avoid crushing of the cells and batteries (which can lead to leakage, venting, rupture, explosion and fire) , unintentional electrical short circuit and corrosion of the terminals.</p>
			<p>To avoid propagation of a thermal runaway the following measures can be taken:</p>
			<ul><li> Place cells, modules and damaged cells, damaged modules in moulted trays before they are packed, can avoid propagation of a thermal runaway</li>
			<li>Place battery packs in separated packages and use fire resistant material for these packages</li></ul>

			<p>Packagings  shall be constructed and closed so as to prevent any loss of contents when prepared for transport which might be cased under normal conditions of transport, by vibrations, or by changes in temperature, humidity or pressure.</p>
			<p>No dangerous residue shall adhere to the outside of packagings during carriage.</p>
			<p>“Overpack’ means an enclosure used (by a single consignor in the case of Class 7)) to contain one or more packages, consolidated into a single unit easier to handle and stow during carriage;</p>
			<p>Examples of Overpack:</p>
			<ul><li>A loading tray such as a pallet, in which several packages are placed or stacked and secured by a plastics strip, shrink or stretch wrapping or other appropriate means</li>
			<li>An outer protective packaging such as a box or a crate</li></ul>
			<p>“Package’ means the complete product of the packaging operation, consisting of the packaging and its contents prepared for dispatch.</p>
			<p>Dangerous goods shall not be packed together in the same outer packaging or in larger packagings, with dangerous or other goods if they react dangerously with each other and cause:</p>
			<ul><li>Combustion or evolution of considerable heat</li>
			<li>Evolution of flammable, asphyciant, oxidizing or toxic gasses</li>
			<li>The formation of corrosive substances</li>
			<li>The formation of unstable substances</li></ul>
			<p>Before being filed and haned over for carriage, every packaging, including IBCs and large packagings, shell be checked to be free from corrosion, contamination or other defects.</p>
			<p>Any packaging which shows signs of weakening, with reference to the approved prototype shall no loner be used or shall be refurbished so that it can pass the tests required for the prototype.>/p>
			<p><i>Plastic packagings</i></p>
			<p>For plastics drums and jerricans, rigid plastics IBCs and composite IBCs with plastics inner receptacles, unless otherwise approved by the competent authority, the period of use permitted for carriage of dangerous substances shall be five years from the date of manufacture of the receptacles except where a shorter period of use is prescribed because of the nature of the substance to be carried.</p>
			<p><i>Approved packagings</i></p>
			<p>The packs can be used must have passed specific tests and testing conform to the prototype tested.</p>
			<p>Packagings shall be manufactured, reconditioned and tested under a quality assurance programme which satisfies the competent authority.</p>
			<p>Packagings shall bear markings which are durable, legible and readily visible, constituted by a sequence of symbols, letters and numbers, i.e.:</p>

			<p>„Drums “ mean a flat-ended or convex-ended culindrical packaging made out of metal, fibreboardn plasticsn plywood or other suitable material. This definition also includes packagings of other shapes, e.g. round, taper-necked packagings or pail-shaped packagings. Woorden barrels and erricans are not covered by this definition.</p>
			<p>“Jerrican ” means a metal or plastic packaging of rectangular or polygonal cross-section with one or more orifices.
			<p>“Box ” means a packaging with complete rectangular or polygonal faces, made of metal, word , plywood, reconstituted wood, fiberboard, plastics or other suitable material. Small holes for purposes of ease of handling or opening or to meet classification requirements, are permitted as long as they do not compromise the integrity of the packaging during carriage.

			<p>Permitted by road, only with the competent authority authorization, or according to Multilateral Agreement M259 if applicable.</p>
			<p>ADR special provision 661: The competent authority shall define packing methods for these goods and may define a more restrictive transport category or tunnel restriction code.</p>
			<p>Damaged lithium cells, modules or packs means in particular, but are not limited to:</p>
			<ul><li>Cells, modules or packs identified by the manufacturer as being defective for safety reasons</li>
			<li>Cells, modules or packs with damaged or cinsideradbly deformed cases</li>
			<li>Leaking or venting cells, modules or packs</li>
			<li>Cells, modules or packs with faults that cannot be diagnosed prior to carriage to a place of analysis</li></ul>
			<p>ADR – multilateral agreement M259: UN sub-committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, in December 2012 adopted new provisions (SP 376) concerning the carriage of some damaged lithium cells, modules or packs which should be included in the ADR 2015. Multilateral agreement M259 allows countries who signed it to apply those provisions beforehand.

			<h3><strong>Lithium batteries in vehicles</strong></h3>	
			<p><b>UN3171 Battery-powered vehicles:</b> This entry only applies to vehicles powered by lithium ion batteries which are transported with these batteries installed. For the purpose of this special provision, vehicles are self-probelled apparatus fesigned to carry one of more persons or goods. Exampes of such vehicles are electrically-powered cars, scooters, three and four-wheeled vehicles or mororcycles, battery-assisted bicycles (e bikes), wheelchairs, lawn tractors, boats and aircraft. Examples of equipment are lawnmowers, cleaning machine, model boats and model aircraft.</p>
