			<h3><strong>Purpose and scope</strong></h3>
			<p>Inside one production line where batteries are handled, internal logistics and storage of cells, modules or packs occurs. 
				For example logistics from receiving zone of at a plant to the storage or to the production. In each step batteries are handled (lifted, placed, moved) by operators. 
				Appropriate measures need to be taken to come to a safe logistics and storage process.</p>								
			<h3><strong>Structure of the process</strong></h3>
			<p>The internal logistics process can start from the receiving zone of a plant or from a line in a plant. From here on components 
				can go to the production line or to the storage. If they are placed in storage, they need to be packed appropriate and moved into 
				the storage area. This area can be a dedicated area for battery storage or a normal storage area. After storage the components 
				can be moved to the main production line.</p>
