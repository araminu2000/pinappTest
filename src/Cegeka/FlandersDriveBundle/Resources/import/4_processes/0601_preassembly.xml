			<p>After unpacking the pack can be placed on the production line. To avoid electrocution at the line, the connectors of the pack need to be covered and high voltage gloves are needed.  The temperature need also be checked when the packs are on the production line.</p>
			<p>To avoid leakage, the enclosure of the packs need to be resistant against the mechanical abuse which can cause the leakage.</p>
