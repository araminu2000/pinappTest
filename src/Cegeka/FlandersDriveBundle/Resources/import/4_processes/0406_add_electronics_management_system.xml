		<p>Electronics and management system are added to the pack to be able to monitor the pack when it is used in an application.</p>
		<p>Electrocution and external short circuit stay the main risks during this step. To avoid these risk the necessary measures need to be taken:</p>
		<ul><li>Covering current connector</li>
		<li>Use of high voltage tools</li>
		<li>Use of high voltage gloves</li></ul>
		<p>To avoid the start of a thermal runaway, electrical and mechanical abuse shall always be avoided during the assembling process. The temperature need to be checked on a regular base.</p>
		<p>The connectors to connect the pack with other systems are also placed in this step. These can be data or power connectors.</p>
