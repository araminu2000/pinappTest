			<p>When the vehicle is delivered to the customer, time should be taken to inform the driver as much as possible. Some topics to give information about are:</p>
			<ul><li>Procedure to charge the vehicle</li>
			<li>Information on the high voltage risks. The customer doesn't probably have enough knowledge about the high voltage risk or proper tooling. 
			The customer should therefor be discouraged to work close to or on the battery pack.</li>			
			<li>Safety guidelines and how to react in case of emergency situations</li>
			<li>Maintenance of the vehicle</li></ul>
			<p>All information shall be added to the vehicle user manual which should be available for the customer</p>
