			<p>When a damaged pack is disassembled, components which could be reusable can be kept for possible reuse. This is certainly the case for electronics and electric components.</p>
			<p>Care shall be taken when modules are reused. A module can always be abused mechanically, electrically or thermally. At first instance this may not effected on the performance, but it could have effected the module in such a way that a thermal runaway will occur when the module is reused. 
			Only when detailed history data of the module are known, (e.g. temperature data show that no excessive temperatures have occurred) and when the performance of the module can be measured, the possibility of reusing a module could exist.</p>
