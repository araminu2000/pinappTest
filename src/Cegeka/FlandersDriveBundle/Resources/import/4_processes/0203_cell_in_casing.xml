			<p>Once the cells are checked and measured they can be placed into the casing to start the actual assembling of the module.</p>
			<p>In this step two risk need to be avoided:</p>
			<ul><li>External short circuit: keep one of the current connectors covered as long as possible</li>
			<li>Leakage: mechanical abuse of the cell can lead to leakage. It is therefore important that the 
			enclosure of the cells is resistant against mechanical abuse, that blunt tooling is avoided and that
			the casing in which the cells are placed doesnâ€™t contain impurities. The casing should be checked before using</li></ul>
			<p>To avoid decrease the severity of injuries from the external short circuit safety gloves and glasses shall be used.</p>
