			<p> ADD RECOMMENDATIONS </p>
			<p>When the batteries (cell, module or pack) are stored, the following safety aspects need to be taken into consideration</p>
			<ul><li>To avoid deterioration of the performance and/or surface corrosion due to high temperature or humidity, the batteries need to be stored in well ventilated, dry and cool conditions.</li> 
			<li>The battery cartons may not be stacked higher than specified by the manufacturer. The batteries in the lowest carton may be deformed and leakage may occur due to the weight.</li>
			<li>Donâ€™t store or display batteries in direct sun or places where they get exposed to rain. The storage should be a controlled environment.</li>
			<li>Use only original packages for the battery storage. When batteries are unpacked and mixed they may be short-circuited or damaged.</li>
			<li>To detect an early temperature increase in a battery (which can lead to a thermal runaway) the temperature of a stored components need to be checked regularly</li>
			<li>When damaged components are stored, extra awareness and monitoring is needed. In these cases the probability on a thermal runaway, increases.</li></ul>
