			<p>In the first step of the module assembly the cells are unpacked: the inner packing is removed. 
			Once a cell is unpacked the risk of external short circuit exists. It is therefore recommended to cover 
			one of the current collectors to avoid the external short circuit. Keeping the cells as long as possible 
			on the moulded cell trays is also a measure to avoid short circuit. The operator shall use safety gloves 
			and glasses when handling cell to decrease the severity of injuries due to an external short circuit.</p>
