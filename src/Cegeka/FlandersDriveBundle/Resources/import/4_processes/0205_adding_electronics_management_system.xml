			<p>Electronics and management system are added to the module to be able to monitor the module when it is used in an application.</p>
			<p>During this step measures need to be taken to avoid electrical short circuit, leakage and thermal runaway. These measures are:</p>
			<ul><li>Covering current connector</li>
			<li>Avoid blunt tooling</li>
			<li>Avoid electrical and mechanical abuse</li></ul>
			<p>To decrease the effects of the risks, the operator shall wear safety gloves and glasses which protect against heat, sparks and electrolyte. Monitoring the temperature can help to detect a thermal runaway in a early stage.</p>
