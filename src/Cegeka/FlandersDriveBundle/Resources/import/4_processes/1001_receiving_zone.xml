			<p>It is assumed that during logistics the service disconnect is disconnected and no places which can lead to short circuit 
			exists at the exterior of the pack. The risk of electrocution is in this case very low. The normal safety rules of internal 
			transport need to be taken into account to avoid mechanical abuse. This abuse can lead to external shirt circuit inside the 
			pack, leakage, gas formation. For pack it is also important to avoid thermal abuse. This can occur when packs are outside t
			he building in the sun or in a hot environment. A good practice is to check the temperature of the pack on a regular base.</p>
