			<p>For damaged packs, a high risk on electrocution exists. To avoid electrocution high voltage tools and high voltage gloves need to be used when the pack is removed from the vehicle. The connectors of the pack need to be covered as soon as possible</p>
			<p>When a damaged pack is removed from the vehicle, measures are needed to avoid electrical abuse. The enclosure shall be resistant against internal pressure. This is needed to avoid rupture when gas formation due to electrical abuse occurs. Due to the electrical abuse the temperature can increase at the connectors. It is recommended to monitor these temperatures.</p>
			<p>The operator shall use the correct protective gloves and glasses.</p>
