			<p>When a damaged module is disassembled, components which could be reusable can be kept for possible reuse. This is certainly the case for electronics and electric components.</p>
			<p>Care shall be taken when cells are reused. A cell can always be abused mechanically, electrically or thermally. At first instance this may not effected on the performance, but it could have effected the cell in such a way that a thermal runaway will occur when the cell is reused. 
			Only when detailed history data of the cell are known, (e.g. temperature data show that no excessive temperatures have occurred) and when the performance of the cell can be measured, the possibility of reusing a cell could exist.</p>
