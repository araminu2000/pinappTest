			<p>If the pack which need to be extracted is damaged, extra care should be taken. In a damaged pack gas formation can occur. To avoid sever
			injuries caused by rupture of the pack and gas release, the technicians should wear the appropriate personal protection measures (e.g. safety glasses). 
			Care should be taken to avoid electrical abuse. This could lead to gas formation and temperature increase at the connectors.</p>
